# Strategies for studying jquery.

1. Look for multiple resources
2. Skim each resource to see if they are good for beginners
3. Create a list of viable resources
4. Use these resources to deepen my knowledge of Jquery

> Resources that will help have to be readable, understandable and practicable. I feel like a break around 45mins to 60 mins usually is best practice for my own learning.

> Breaks are important for me, otherwise my mind starts to get on a low frequency for learning.

> I plan to approach this topic with an open mind, and I also just want to try and grow in my ability to research, whether it be through Google, or some other means. I'll probably also try using the Jquery and their functions as I research.
