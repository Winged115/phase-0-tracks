Commands to a robot on how to use an elevator.
Important notes to consider: 
~An elevator is a tool for traveling up and down floors of a building.
~Each floor is denoted with a symbol, usually a combination of integers and strings Example :L=Lobby(ground floor) B1-BX=floors below lobby 1-X=floors above lobby.
~The elevator could possibly be traveling up or down.
~The input you press is your desired floor to exit.
~Before you enter the elevator it has two inputs either an up symbol or a down symbol, the two exceptions being if you are either on the top or bottom floor.
~Before entering an elevator you must decide if your desired floor is above or below the floor you are currently on, then press the appropriate input(up or down symbol).
~floors have a floor indicator outside of the elevator to denote which floor you are on.
Algorithm/psuedocode:
-Identify which floor you are on, call it c_floor (current_floor)
-Identify which floor you want to go to, call it d_floor.(desired_floor)
	-Until c_floor equals d_floor:
		-If d_floor is above c_floor:
			-input up_arrow
			-when elevator arrives at c_floor enter the elevator.
			-press the button with the corresponding input of d_floor
		-If d_floor is below c_floor:
			-input down_arrow
			-when elevator arrives at c_floor enter the elevator.
			-press the button with the corresponding input of d_floor
	-When c_floor equals d_floor:
		-exit elevator
			
#so far Iâ€™m thinking in terms of a ruby method at this moment if its called Elevator(c_floor, d_floor).UNTIL c_floor == d_floor IF c_floor > d_floor: c_floor = c_floor - 1 ELSE c_floor < d_floor: c_floor = c_floor + 1 END END END
