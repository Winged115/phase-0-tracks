Commands to a robot on how to use an elevator.
Important notes to consider: 
~An elevator is a tool for traveling up and down floors of a building.
~Each floor is denoted with a symbol, usually a combination of integers and strings Example :L=Lobby(ground floor) B1-BX=floors below lobby 1-X=floors above lobby.
~The elevator could possibly be traveling up or down.
~The input you press is your desired floor to exit.
~Before you enter the elevator it has two inputs either an up symbol or a down symbol, the two exceptions being if you are either on the top or bottom floor.
~Before entering an elevator you must decide if your desired floor is above or below the floor you are currently on, then press the appropriate input(up or down symbol).
~floors have a floor indicator outside of the elevator to denote which floor you are on.
Algorithm/psuedocode:
-Identify which floor you(robot) are on, call it c_floor (current_floor)
-Identify which floor you(robot) want to go to, call it d_floor.(desired_floor)
	-Until c_floor equals d_floor(Until you are on your desired floor):
		-If d_floor is above c_floor:
			-input up_arrow
			-when elevator arrives(You{robot} will know because it will make a *ding* sound) at c_floor enter the elevator.
			-press the button with the corresponding input of d_floor
			-wait in elevator(you{robot} will hear nasty Muzak playing)
		-If d_floor is below c_floor:
			-input down_arrow
			-when elevator arrives(same *ding* noise) at c_floor enter the elevator.
			-press the button with the corresponding input of d_floor
			-wait in elevator(same torturous Muzak)
	-When c_floor equals d_floor:
		-exit elevator
			
#so far I’m thinking in terms of a ruby method at this moment if its called Elevator(c_floor, d_floor).UNTIL c_floor == d_floor IF c_floor > d_floor: c_floor = c_floor - 1 ELSE c_floor < d_floor: c_floor = c_floor + 1 END END END

Common Task Algorithm: Choosing What to Eat For Lunch (I work at a grocery store, so the steps begin inside the building)

-Identify if I’m hungry or not hungry
-Identify if I’m feeling healthy or don’t care
-Identify if I’m willing to spend more than 10 dollars
	-If I’m feeling hungry, healthy, and willing to spend more than 10 dollars:
		-select an avocado,canned salmon(no salt/in water), cold pressed green juice, and inner peas #this may give away where I work.
	-If I’m feeling hungry, don’t care, and willing to spend more than 10 dollars
		-go to Five Guys
	-If I’m feeling hungry, healthy, and willing to spend less than 10 dollars.
		-select an avocado, baby carrots, an apple, and sparkling water
	-If I’m feeling hungry, don’t care, and willing to spend less than 10 dollars.
		-select a bag of potato chips, and 2 juice packs
	-If I’m not feeling hungry, but healthy, and am willing to spend more than 10 dollars.
		-go to The Artist Cafe
	-If I’m not feeling hungry, don’t care, and am willing to spend more than 10 dollars.
		-No food
	-If I’m not feeling hungry, but healthy and am willing to spend less than 10 dollars.
		-select an apple and a banana
	-If I’m not feeling hungry, don’t care, and am willing to spend less than 10 dollars.
		-select a pretzel, and chocolate covered bananas
-Eat what I have until I feel sated
