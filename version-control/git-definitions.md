# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 Version control is the way of saving projects, giving them checkpoints, and keeping them orginized, sorry my spelling. This is useful for checking for bugs thru different commits, it allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time, it also safeguards projects/folders.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 A branch is a copy of the master project, so for example if I opened this .md in the master branch none of my answers would be here. I would use a branch to write my own code but at the same time it doesn't mess up the working master branch if I've made an error somewhere. It allows for me to work on specific changes to the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 A commit is a save point in whichever branch you are working in. A good commit message is concise and precise. It will explain what was modified in the most understandable and direct way.
* What is a merge conflict?
 I actually had a merge conflict in 1.4, so from it I'd gather that a merge conflict or an example of one is when two lines of code from different branches have conflicting information. If I had a 2nd branch with comepletely different answers in here and I merged this into the master branch, then tried merging the 2nd branch I would get a large CONFLICT message and git would tell me to resolve the conflict.
